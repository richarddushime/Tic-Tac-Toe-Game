## Tic-tac-toe game 
This is a basic implementation of a tic-tac-toe game in Python.
It uses a list to represent the game board, and has functions for printing the board, getting player moves,
checking for victory conditions, and checking for draws.

The game loop iterates until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
